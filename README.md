## Introduction
<p align="justify">
    The main aim of this Computer Graphics Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts and usage of pre-built functions as well as user defined functions in OpenGL. Mario Shooter is a 2D shooter game in which the player moves a character Mario along horizontally and vertically across the screen and fires at aliens overhead.The aliens begin as five rows of ten that move left and right as a group, shifting downward each time it reaches a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them. While the player has three lives, the game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen. The character has two missiles which are fired by a single key-f. There are 4 defences horizontally above the character to protect the playerâ€™s character from enemy shots. There are 3 types of enemies, they all have different scores. Players cannot shoot more than 2 missiles at a time.
